    "# The most powerful quantum algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "*Mathematical analysis is as extensive as nature itself; it defines all perceptible relations, measures times, spaces, forces, temperatures: this difficult science is formed slowly, but it preserves every principle which it has once acquired; it grows and strengthens itself incessantly in the midst of the many variations and errors of the human mind. Its chief attribute is clearness; it has no marks to express confused notations. It brings together phenomena the most diverse and discovers the hidden analogies which unite them.* - Joseph Fourier, The Analytical Theory of Heat (1822) \n",

    "This chapter is atypical of the rest of this textbook. Here a rather lengthy historical introduction is given in an attempt to convey the power of what could be considered the most powerful quantum algorithm. It is what drives Shor's algorithm along with every other quantum algorithm with exponential scaling. \n",

    "Waves surround us. Light travels from the sun to our eyes and sound travels from vibrating objects to our ears and those two waves comprise much of our experience of reality. For both light and sound, what we are sensitive to is small changes of intensity, the power per unit area, that the complex network of our sense organs and brain are able to process and interpret as what we see and hear. In engineering, signal processing is extremely important in telecommunications and in physics there are insights we can gain about the nature of solids (condensed matter physics) by performing a similar analysis. In the latter two cases, the mathematics we use to accomplish these tasks is described by various Fourier Transforms. \n",

    "Until the invention of the airplane in 1903, the world could only be circumvented by ship. Sailing ships depended on the winds and the waves to move. Being able to effectively predict the weather & tides became an essential tool for merchant fleets and navies. \n",

    "There are two complete cycles of high-low tides each day. This is caused by the gravitational pull of the moon & the sun. At different times of year, the difference in the distances between the Earth, moon & sun, along with differences in latitude, cause the times of the tides to drift. \n",

    "The standard (computational) basis in which qubits are measured is the z-basis. That is to say we measure all the qubits by projecting them onto the Z-axis of the Bloch Sphere. All our qubits will end up as $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$. Repeated measurements can be used to reveal the probability amplitudes for the $\\ket{0}$ or $\\ket{1}$ states. This is state tomography. However doing this does not reveal anything about the phase of the qubits. In order to extract this information from a measurement, we ust first change our basis. \n",

What this means is that every number stored on every computer is stored to a finite number of decimal points. Even for analogue computers, there is some arbitrary degree to which the precision of a given value can be stored. \n",

    "Perhaps one of the most remarkable differences between quantum & classical information is phase. \n",
    "\n",
    "Phases can be stored classically using complex data structures: a complex number is merely 2 real numbers where one is the real component & the other is the imaginary component.

Therefore, for some arbitrary phase angle $\\phi$, and for a given number of qubits, there is a limit to the accuracy this phase can be estimated (using QPE). The maximum error to which this phase can be measured is given by the angular distance $\\Delta$\n",

    "- Coherence times: For any given $n$, $F$ requires $O(n^3)$ circuit layers. Thus the minimum depth of the circuit also scales with $O(n^3)$. Each layer of the circuit requires some time to be processed. Thus it is necessary to maintain a coherent phase for at least the time taken to complete the QPE algorithm. \n",
    "- SPAM: State Preparation And Measurement. The quantum circuit has to start from the fiduciary state $\\ket{0}^{\\otimes n}$, prepare the phase corresponding to $\\phi_{worst}$, carry out QPE and them perform a measurement in the computational basis. Any error in preparing the state or measuring it will in turn raise the error beyond $\\Delta_{max}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point it is worth pointing out that there is no major consideration for speed. Whether QPE is implemented very quickly or extremely slowly, all other things being equal, it doesn't affect $\\Delta $. Intuitively this makes sense. Precision does not require speed.\n",

    "### Defining a phase figure of merit \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\Delta_{max}$ is useful as a measure of error, but for a more holistic description of the power of a quantum computer, a better figure of merit is needed. \n",

In turn, this number between 0 \\& 1 indicates the probability of measuring $\\ket{\\phi}$ if given the state $\\ket{\\psi}$ (or vice-versa).\n",

    "In the general case, where either or both of the quantum states may be entangled, the density matrix is used instead."
